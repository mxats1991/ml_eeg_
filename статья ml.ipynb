    "Для анализа субъективных оценок RSME был выполнен анализ дисперсии многократных измерений 3 × 3 (сессия: 1, 2, 3; и сложность: легко, средне, сложно). Как и в области субъективных баллов, RMANOVAS выполнялся по выполнению задач отслеживания и мониторинга системы. Это было сделано, так как это были единственные две задачи, оцененные при всех условиях. Для задачи отслеживания в качестве меры производительности использовалось среднее абсолютное расстояние от центра квадрата (среднее расстояние в квадрате корня). Для задачи мониторинга системы использовалось среднее время реакции на сигналы тревоги. Для всех анализов коррекция Greenhouse-Geisser применялась, когда предполагалось предположение о сферичности. Сердечные данные были проанализированы с помощью GLM (Фиксированные факторы: Состояние сеанса x, TOT как ковариат) на зависимых переменных HRV (SDNN или RMSS) и HR (BPM). Для анализа ЭЭГ данные были проанализированы в соответствии со сложностью задачи (Легко; Среднее; Сложно), областью коры (фронтальная и задняя) и тета- и альфа-полосами. GLM (Фиксированные факторы: сессия x Сложность) выполнялась на каждой окупаемости инвестиций (фронтальная, центральная и апостериорная).\n",

    "НАСА разработало задание MATB-II1 для оценки возможности переключения задач и умственной рабочей нагрузки (Santiago-Espada et al., 2011). Здесь участникам представлено до 6 различных задач, которые они должны выполнить одновременно. Это обеспечивает высокореалистичную среду операционных систем, которые исследователь может контролировать для создания различной степени сложности. Использовалась адаптированная версия 2, закодированная в Matlab, но обеспечивающая те же показатели, что и оригинальная задача MATB-II (Verdière et al., 2020). Для получения полного описания первоначальной задачи и подзадач обратитесь к Santiago-Espada и др. (2011). Для этого исследования были использованы комбинации из четырех доступных подзадач MATB. В задаче отслеживания (TRACK) участникам представляется движущаяся цель внутри окна. Цель состоит в том, чтобы, используя джойстик, сохранить цель в окне. Степень сложности может быть изменена путем изменения степени и скорости, с которой движется цель. Для задачи мониторинга системы (SYSMON) участники должны отслеживать датчики и предупреждающие огни. Действие требуется при отсутствии зеленого света, наличии красного света и отклонениях четырех движущихся циферблатов указателей от средней точки. Задача мониторинга системы управляется вводом в конкретные команды клавиатуры. Степень сложности может быть адаптирована путем увеличения количества событий, на которые участник должен реагировать. В задаче связи (COMM) участники должны прослушать радиосообщения и определить, важны ли они для оператора (вызов его/ее позывного) или нет (вызов другого позывного). Если сообщение актуально, оператор должен изменить частоту радиоканала на частоту, указанную в сообщении. Последняя используемая задача - это задача управления ресурсами (RESMAN). Участникам представлен интерфейс, показывающий два основных резервуара и четыре вспомогательных резервуара, соединенные между собой через восемь насосов с различными расходами топлива. Цель состоит в том, чтобы поддерживать определенный уровень жидкости в обоих основных резервуарах. Участники могут сделать это, активировав или отключив насосы. Чтобы увеличить сложность задачи, могут быть введены такие события, как сбои насоса. В текущем исследовании участники выполнили три независимых 5-минутных пробега с тремя степенями сложности (т.е. см. сценарии 2, 3 и 4 в Кабоне и др., 2006). Для легкого состояния участники занимаются только мониторингом системы и задачей отслеживания. Для среднего состояния участники участвуют в обеих задачах, а также в задаче по управлению топливом. Для сложного состояния добавляется коммуникационная задача, а также усложняется задача отслеживания. Перед началом каждого забега участники также получили краткую инструкцию."
